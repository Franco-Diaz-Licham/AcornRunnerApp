# Description:
Acorn Runner is a small python game application that allows users play a maze-like escape game, where the character "the acorn" needs to travel through
a forest maze to get to the finish line to win the game. There are various levels of difficulty inclucing mazes where there are forest fires that 
the acorn needs to put out with water, if it is blocking the way to the finish line. There are also teleportation spots that can aid the acorn to hop to various part of the maze.

# Overview
The user can use the following keys to move:
1. "W" = move Up
2. "A" = move Left
3. "D" = move Right
4. "S" = move down
